With the resell market itself currently valued at $2 billion (per <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/most-expensive-sneakers-sold-last-year-resale-2019-4\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Business Insider</u></a>), it is projected to hit <b>$6 billion by 2025</b>.\n          <br/><br/>\n          The widespread impact of sneakers is simply undisputable. Josh Luber, the CEO of StockX, mentions that “sneakers are this thing where first of all, it's a pure supply and demand market. Even if you're not in the same category, <b>almost everybody has some association with sneakers at some point</b>… It just touches so many people in so many different ways.” They have become a defining part of everything culture, seeping into sports, music, art, you name it.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"Industry-Paragraph\">\n        <h2>Resilient to Recession</h2>\n        <p>\n          Unlike other traditional investment markets, streetwear has proven to be resilient to external shocks. One prime example is the coronavirus, which led the stock market to plummet <b>30%</b> within the first month. To see whether the same was observed in the sneaker market, we crafted a sneaker index, which consists of the most popular sneakers at the time. What we found was astounding: the market only went down <b>7.15%</b>. This only reinforced our belief: people are always looking to buy sneakers, no matter the situation.\n        </p>\n        <h3 class=\"Index-Title\"></h3>\n        <div class=\"Index-Chart\">\n          <h3>Sneaker Index</h3>\n          <br></br>\n          <Img fluid={data.index.childImageSharp.fluid} />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"Industry-Paragraph\">\n        <h2>Here's how we take advantage of this market</h2>\n        <p>\n          The Hype Advisor employs a fundamental research-intensive approach to streetwear investment with the ambition to analyze and <b>make projections for any sneaker</b> on the market.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Data has become <b>the core of decision-making</b> in the streetwear industry, whether it be on the consumer or reseller side. Hundreds of thousands of users flock to websites such as StockX and Goat daily to analyze a streetwear item’s performance on the resale market. Millennials of our generation often consult social media accounts for resale predictions and future profitability.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          However, we strive to not only organize this data, but also interpret it in ways that will greatly <b>increase the efficiency of which items are bought and sold</b>.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"Industry-Paragraph\">\n        <h2>Here are the opportunities <i>The Hype Advisor</i> provides for you:</h2>\n        <p>\n          <b>Access.</b> Sneakers provide many of the similar benefits, even more, compared to traditional assets such as stocks and bonds.\n          <div class=\"Industry-Chart\">\n            <Img fluid={data.chart.childImageSharp.fluid} />\n          </div>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <b>Diversification.</b> For the longest time, investors have been limited to investing in stocks and bonds.
